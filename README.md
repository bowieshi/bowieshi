## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Shi Boao**. My English name is Bowie. I am currently a research assistant at Penn GRASP Lab. I am also a final year undergraduate majoring in **Computer Science** from The University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in **4D Reconstruction and 4D Generation**, more specifically, about motion synthesis and interaction for real-world entities, like humans, objects and scenes.
