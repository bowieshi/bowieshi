## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Shi Boao. My English name is Bowie. I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong. My research interests lie in Embodied AI. Recently, I have been focusing on human motion modeling, especially on human-scene interaction. If your research lies in the same direction, welcome to connect and communicate!
