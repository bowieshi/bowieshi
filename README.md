## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Shi Boao**. My English name is Bowie. I am currently a research assistant at Penn GRASP Lab. I am also a final year undergraduate majoring in **Computer Science** from The University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in **general 3D and 4D**.

I am quite interested in the following questions:

- How can we infer the physical state and dynamics of the world from causal monocular observation (single RGB camera)?
- How can we encode motion, deformation, and interaction such that they obey physical plausibility and generalize?
- How can we extract generalizable priors of how humans interact with the world, and how to apply it to humanoid control policy?
