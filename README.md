## Hi there 👋

My name is **Shi Boao**. My English name is Bowie. I am currently a research assistant at Penn GRASP Lab. I am also a final year undergraduate majoring in **Computer Science** from The University of Hong Kong.

My research interests lie in **general 3D and 4D**.
Several directions/topics I am interested in:

- Character animation
- 3D/4D Reconstruction
- Learning from human video
- Humanoid control policy

I am quite interested in the following questions:

- How can we infer the physical state and dynamics of the world from causal monocular observation (general web video setting)?
- How can we encode motion, deformation, and interaction such that they obey physical law and generalize?
- How can we extract scalable and generalizable priors of how humans interact with the world, and how to apply it to humanoid control policy?
