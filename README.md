## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Shi Boao**. My English name is Bowie. I am a junior undergraduate majoring in **Computer Science** from The University of Hong Kong. I am currently interning at Penn GRASP Lab.

My research interests lie in **4D Reconstruction and 4D Generation**, more specifically, about motion synthesis for any real-world entities (humans, objects, scenes, articulated, deformable, ...).
